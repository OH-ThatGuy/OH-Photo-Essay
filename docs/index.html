                <p>Completed in 2001, the Larry and Kathryn Smith Chapel has become a place of
                    worship for many students at Penn State Behrend. It’s located right on campus
                    next to the Burke building. For any students living on campus, the chapel is
                    only ever a short walk away. The chapel itself features a carillon made up of 48
                    bells; this wonderful instrument was gifted to the university along with the
                    bell tower itself by the late Floyd and Juanita Smith. Since its creation, the
                    chapel has been the site of various weddings, events, and other religious
                    services.</p>

            <p>When the chapel was first constructed, it was done so as a place of multi-faith
                worship, the building itself taking heavy influence from Christian faith. Within
                Christianity, it is taught that humanity must act as stewards of the land. Nearly
                every religion teaches the value of protecting one’s environment. Whether it be
                Christianity, Buddhism, or Islam, they all have some sort of doctrine involving
                nature and its upkeep. The caretakers of the Larry and Kathryn Smith Chapel know
                this well, and it’s apparent just by looking at it.</p>

            <p>When observing the chapel and its surrounding environment, it’s noticeable right away
                how well the area is maintained. It’s almost as if the chapel grew there along with
                the grass and trees. There’s vegetation all over, with various flowers and other
                flora growing by the building. It’s also not uncommon to see wildlife roam about the
                area. Birds perch on nearby trees, squirrels and other rodents run around searching
                for food, and insects can be seen crawling in the grass. Nature is everywhere you
                look, but it would be disingenuous to say that everything is perfect.</p>

            <p>Despite the care taken to preserve the nature surrounding the chapel, it’s hard not
                to notice the signs of human presence. Ignoring the chapel itself, the most obvious
                thing you’ll notice is the Burke building. While Burke is a well-made and frankly
                nice-looking building, it does stick out like a sore thumb compared to the
                brick-and-mortar architecture of the chapel. The various walkways around the chapel
                make human traversal quite easy, but insects who rely on grass to hide from
                predators can struggle. Speaking of grass, it’s cut regularly. It looks quite nice,
                but the grass is often cut quite low. Last but not least are the lamps that line the
                sidewalks. Light pollution is a growing concern among environmentalists, and the
                design of Behrend’s lamps doesn’t do anything to remedy it. Not only that, but the
                lamps also interfere with the natural cycles of nocturnal insects.</p>

            <section>
                <p>In conclusion, the Larry and Kathryn Smith Chapel stands as a testament to the
                    relationship between faith and nature. It embodies the principles of stewardship
                    that are taught across various religions. However, the presence of modern human
                    interference is noticeable and reminds us of challenges that come with balancing
                    nature and humanity. I am hopeful that the future of the chapel is bright, and
                    the future of the world surrounding it even brighter.</p>
